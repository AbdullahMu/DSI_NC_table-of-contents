## Introduction

Give 1-2 sentences that introduce the topic being covered and relate it to the theme(s) of the week. Be creative and frame the lab deliverable(s) from a real world perspective; when would they be expected to perform a task like this in real life? Help connect their work to a larger career or industry focus.

## Requirements

- Have it do something else
- This is what we expect of you

**Bonus:**
- Some extra ideas for medium/advanced students
- Another thing that would be good for you to practice
