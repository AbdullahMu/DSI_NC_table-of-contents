# Templates and Styleguide

In this folder, you'll find GA's campus education baseline templates for [lessons](./baseline-lessons), [labs](./baseline-labs), and [projects](./baseline-projects), as well as examples of completed products.

Instructors should also make use of our templates for [homework assignments](./instructor-homeworks) and [morning-exercises](./instructor-morning-exercises).

Read through our [styleguide](../resources/guidelines/styleguide.md) and check out our [contributing guidelines](../resources/guidelines/contributing-guidelines.md) to get started.
