#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Donâ€™t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of _____ points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
