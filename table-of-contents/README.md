> Globally, we have 7 Weekly Projects and 1 Capstone Project (subdivided into 5 deliverables). Each project builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance over the entire course.

## Project Specs

Each project includes objectives, requirements, starter-code, rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec files to read more about each project.

> See our [feedback guidelines](./project-feedback.md) to read more about how to provide feedback on student projects.

### Grading & Using GitHub in the Classroom

Instructors should use GitHub to release student-facing materials and project feedback. Students should post assignments to individual student repos and submit links or pull requests to the instructor's repository. Instructors can comment on pull requests and either push graded rubrics to individual student repositories or submit them via Slack/dropbox (for privacy).
