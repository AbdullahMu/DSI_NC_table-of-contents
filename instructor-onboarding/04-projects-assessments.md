Our goal is to provide meaningful suggestions and personal guidance for all of our students. While there will undoubtedly be nuances in how everyone evaluates student portfolio projects, using these guidelines will ensure that students get the personalized feedback they deserve.

 - Format, clean, slice, and combine data
 - Create derived columns for new data, when necessary

5. **Refine the Data**

 - Identify trends and outliers
 - Apply descriptive and interential statistics

## Project Arc

Globally, we have 7 Weekly Projects and 1 Capstone Project, subdivided into 5 deliverables. Each one builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance. The goal is to give students multiple opportunities to practice and refine their skills, in order to demonstrate a high quality Capstone project.

#### Project Specs

Each project includes objectives, requirements, a grading rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec files to read more about each project.

| **Unit 4** | [Capstone, Part 4](../03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-04/) | Assigned Week 8 | Due Week 11 |
| **Unit 4** | [Capstone, Part 5](../03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-05/) | Assigned Week 8 | Due Week 12 |

#### Project Due Dates

**When should students submit their Projects?**

The baseline curriculum schedule assumes that students are assigned projects on Mondays and submit projects over the weekend. *However, some instructors have found better results assigning projects on Fridays and making them due the following Friday.* Your schedule can be adjusted to suit the needs of your students.

## Course Expectations

In order to pass this course, General Assembly students **MUST**:

- Complete and submit **80% of all course assignments, including homework and weekly projects.**
- Complete and submit the Capstone Project, **including all 5 deliverables.**
- Adhere to [GA's Student Code of Conduct](../../resources/syllabus/student-code-of-conduct.md).

---

## Rubrics

Rubrics are provided for all student projects to help you deliver structured feedback. For specific tips on using and applying rubrics, see our [Project Feedback Guide](../03-projects/project-feedback.md).

### Guiding Principles

- Rubrics are based on a **simple 3-point scale**: "Incomplete", "Does Not Meet Expectations", and "Meets Expectations." These are tailored for each project. 
- Metrics for "meets expectations" are clearly defined to help you provide **targeted feedback.**
- In some instances, a bonus "Exceeds Expectations" can also be achieved, depending on the project requirements.

### Feedback Guidelines

- Students should be given a copy of the blank rubric along with their project prompt.
- Rubric categories and evaluation metrics should be tied to project specifications.
- Instructors should work with their team to provide targeted feedback for **every** student.
- Students should receive prompt feedback **within 2 - 4 days** after submission!

### Bonus

Bonus activities are meant to supplement and challenge advanced students. Attempting bonus activities **should not adversely affect** a student's grade. If bonus requirements are met, students may earn additional points; if bonus requirements are not met, no points should be subtracted.

## Grading Assignments & Providing Feedback

> Note: For an in-depth look at how to give quality feedback, please see our [Project Feedback Guide](../03-projects/project-feedback.md).

We've created a sample Google assignment submission form you can copy to use for your own class. It asks students to link to their work, state any specific issues/questions, and describe their preferred feedback format. It also asks whether they would prefer to receive ***public*** feedback on Github or ***private*** feedback on Slack.

You can optionally adjust this form to limit the type of assignments they should submit, using the titles from the drop-down menu.

- [DSI Project / Assignment Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/150tR5HfHoFt9nEZBHBJWZoS62mrqCb_xshYHFqTrrSg/edit?usp=sharing)

> Note: Feel free to modify this workflow based on local production team feedback.
