The following document provides a set of basic guidelines for your responsibilities as an instructor.

## Github Workflow

The following represents our suggested instructional team workflow on Github. For [additional guidelines on creating your student facing repository, see these instructions](../../resources/guidelines/github-repo-instance-guide.md).

> You are welcome to adapt the suggested Github workflow to your own needs. Just make sure to leverage baseline materials, create a student facing version, and sync with the baseline for updates, issue logging, or pull requests.

1. Create your local team's "staging branch" off of the DSI-Course-Materials baseline master. This is where you will work to adapt specific materials from the baseline for your cohort's needs. Make sure to keep this branch synced with any updates to the master.
2. Create a fork from the DSI-course-materials baseline master. You'll need to work with your local production team to do this. Use the following naming structure: "DSI-Location-Instance#" (e.g. "DSI-NYC-1") and set your repo to "private". This will be the repository you'll use to share materials with your students. You can pull material from your branch to this fork.
3. After this you will work with your production team to create a group for your students and give this group read access to your local forked repo. See [these instructions](../../resources/guidelines/github-repo-instance-guide.md) for more details.

> Note: [You can find additional examples of how local instructional teams have implemented and modified this workflow on our Wiki](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/wiki/Github---Instructor-Workflow).

## Planning *Before* the Course

We highly recommend you begin preparing your lessons at least 2-4 weeks before the course starts. A good benchmark is to prepare the first week of lessons before the course actually begins.

During these preparations, you should:

1. Review Curriculum
  - Read through the high-level unit structure, project arcs, and instructor onboarding resources provided.
  - Review objectives, content outlines, and notebook code for all lessons and labs.
  - Brush up on any tools, platforms, or libraries you may be unfamiliar with.

2. Review Projects
  - Read through objectives and starter/solution code for our weekly projects.
  - Read through requirements and suggested schedule for our student capstone project deliverables.
  - Read through our [guide to providing student feedback](../03-projects/project-feedback.md).

3. Create Materials
  - Create or modify morning exercise activities for each week you plan to teach.
  - Create or modify homework assignments for each day you plan to teach.
  - Create or modify slide decks to correspond with lessons and labs you plan to teach.
  
4. Modify Materials
 - Review prior instructor contributions and alternate materials, when applicable. 
 - Decide how you want to incorporate your experiences into lesson and lab materials.
 - Prepare materials for any "flex" sessions you will be teaching.

5. Review Schedule 
  - Work with your campus producer to plan the schedule for your cohort, including holidays and outcomes sessions.
  - Revise the [planning Trello board](https://trello.com/b/63gtwOro) to account for your market's specific schedule. 
  - Confirm the weekly and capstone project schedule and plan to set aside time for grading.

6. Plan Workflow
  - Review suggested Github setup and permissions guide and work with your producer to create your own fork and student-facing site.
  - Determine how you plan to receive student assignment submissions and return graded rubrics and comments.
  - Play around with project datasets to ensure familiarity with timing, troubleshooting, and deliverables.

7. Prepare for Students
  - Review our [required pre-course onboarding tasks](../02-student-onboarding/readme.md) that we require of our students.
  - Ask your producer for access to the [pre-course onboarding assessment](https://mobilega.typeform.com/to/SOC7S7), which will help you gauge your students' initial comfort level with Week 1 curriculum.
  - Review our [course technical guide](06-tech-guide.md) and check with your producer about assisting students during [Installfest](../02-student-onboarding/installfest-lesson/).

> Note: Our goal is to provide you with a content baseline. Please feel free to add or supplement the curriculum with materials based on your own experience and students' comfort level. If you'd like to suggest curriculum revisions, please check out [our contributing guidelines](../../contributing.md).

## Planning *During* the Course

Lead instructors should get out of the classroom for at least 2 hours per day to plan for class and grade student work.  These instructors should find this time during lessons they are not leading or during labs, after the activity has been introduced, as students should be working independently. 

Also, at least 4 days before the start of each week, the instructional team should come together to decide who is responsible for preparing for and facilitating what lessons/labs during the following week.


## Communication

Set clear office hours and make yourself available to your students. Primary methods for communication include:
- Slack
- Email

### Slack: Expectations

Slack is a real-time messaging platform that allows you to communicate as a class. Your producer will set up a course channel for you on Slack, giving you and your students access to a global community!

You should use Slack to communicate as a class. It's extremely useful for taking attendance, notifying groups, or updating students 1:1.

Follow the instructions below to sign up for slack.

* Visit the following [site](https://slack.com/downloads) to download the application.
* Sign up using your email and join your class Slack channel.
* Upload a profile picture to Slack.

### Email: Expectations

You should reserve email for sending messages to the entire class or documenting specific issues with individual students.
