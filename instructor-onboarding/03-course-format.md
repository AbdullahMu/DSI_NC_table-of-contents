## Pre-Course

#### Prerequisite(s)

Current prerequisites for this course:

- You do not need to have a background in stats, programming, or data science for this course (although a background in data analytics is preferred).
- Students must complete the [required Onboarding Modules](../02-student-onboarding/readme.md), which review statistics fundamentals, basic python syntax, basic SQL syntax, git fundamentals, and the command line.
- Students are ***strongly suggested to use Macs***. PC users are **required** to use an Ubuntu Linux VM in order to participate in class. A preliminary [technical guide is provided to them upon enrolling in class](../02-student-onboarding/student-tech-guide.md)
- Students are asked to run through a [pre-course "Installfest"](../02-student-onboarding/installfest-lesson/) to install necessary tools prior to the first day.

#### Students Admissions and On-Boarding Task

All information relating to DSI pre-course tasks, including student admissions and product on-boarding, can be found on [the GA DSI Confluence site](https://generalassembly.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CEP/DSI+Pre-Course).

## Course Syllabus

[Linked here is our Baseline Course Syllabus](../../resources/syllabus/dsi-syllabus.pdf) where you can find unit and weekly content breakdowns along with project milestones. This is a useful student-facing document.


## Holidays

#### What is the suggested holiday schedule? How does it affect the class?

Here are some tips that can help ensure that you cover all the material provided:

- Assign some of the labs and independent activities as homework.
- Get started on a weekly project during class and ask students to complete it over the holidays.
- Scaffold the capstone project earlier, so even if you miss a week due to a holiday break, you can still cover the rest of the material.
- Try not to fall behind the weekly schedule. The closer you are to the curriculum baseline, the easier it will be to cover all the materials.

**Reminder**: Immersives courses can add days to account for holiday breaks, so don't worry about having to restructure the course. Just work with your production team to schedule and communicate any extra days as needed!
