## DATA SCIENCE IMMERSIVE

Congratulations on joining the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly! We can’t wait to get started, so we’ve outlined a few assignments to get everyone on the same page. These onboarding tasks will prepare you to hit the ground running; depending on your level of prior knowledge, these tutorials, modules, and projects may take you between 40-60 hours to complete.

Please complete **all** items **before** your first day of class, so that both you and your computer will be prepared to hit the ground running. If you have questions in the meantime (or just want to say hi!), feel free to reach out to your instructional team!

Sincerely,

GA + the DSI Instructional Team

## Welcome! What Can I Expect From the Onboarding?

Your onboarding tasks include a number of **required** and **optional** tutorials to help you review the fundamentals of *statistics*, *python*, *SQL*, *git*, and the *command line*. These tutorials are hosted on [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/). They encompass a set of simulated challenges that assess your mastery of each concept. 

Please Note: ***GA has paid for your first month of access to this platform.***

After the first month, you will also have the opportunity to renew your membership for a second month at a 25% discount and any additional months thereafter at the full price.

#### Objectives

By the end of our required onboarding tasks, you should be able to:

- Recall basic python programming syntax, including variables, functions, lists, and dictionaries.
- Demonstrate how to use the command line to navigate folders, edit files, and interact with programs. 
- Define the purpose and benefit of working with git and github to manage your code.
- Describe how to use python to compute basic inferential statistics, including standard deviation, correlation, and linear regression.
- Demonstrate how to construct simple queries in order to sort and filter data from a database.
- Discuss the use and purpose of dataframes and how they can be used to manipulate data with Pandas (a popular python library).

Depending on your background, you should be able to complete all of the **required** modules within a month by spending at least 15-20 hours a week on the platform.

#### If you find yourself thinking…

         “This stuff is way too easy, is this course actually going to challenge me?”

The purpose of these tasks is to make sure that everyone starts the course on the same page. If you are speeding through this material, you’re in a great place to start the course, and we’ve included bonus material for you to work through. Don’t worry, you’ll be challenged in this course - we like to take it slow in the beginning but will ramp up fast!

         “This stuff is way too hard, am I going to be able to keep up?”

That’s why you’re doing these assignments in the first place - so that you can get up to speed! We’ll be reviewing these concepts in the first week as well so if you don’t get it now, you’ll have a chance to fully catch up by the end of the first week of class.

* [ ] **Optional**: Check your email for instructions on how to join our `GA-Students` Slack group where you can join the `#dsi-onboarding` channel to meet and swap resources with your fellow students!

#### A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

During orientation, we’ll also be providing you with instructions on how to install the following technologies: 

 * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - We will be using Python & its packages as our primary language
 * [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - We will be using Anaconda as our primary development environment
 * [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) - We’ll be using Postgres for local SQL-based data storage
