    "The focus of this group EDA practice, is to present within the given frame, to a high level, non-technical audience.  Please give focus to the given goals and how achievable they are in terms of factual numbers.  Not everything is achievable, so it's important to explain why to an audience that doesn't know anything about numbers.  In the event that a goal can't be achieved, explain why in simple language, backing up your reasoning with measurable details.\n",

    "However, it's also important to look at the details and address the class with your approach.  A notebook presentation is fine for the technical aspect but your main priority should be to address a non-technical audience.  Keep in mind that it's good to explain your code, but **always frame everything you present in terms of the goals**.  If what you're choosing to present isn't relevent to the goals, please consider ommitting those details.\n",
