> _Every student should have a chance to understand how they're doing and to get valuable feedback on the work they've done from trusted mentors in the classroom._

Our goal is to provide meaningful suggestions and personal guidance to all of our students. While there will undoubtedly be nuances in how everyone evaluates individual student portfolio projects, using these guidelines will ensure that your students get the personalized feedback they deserve.

## What to Grade
In DSI, students are required to complete **all 5 deliverables** from their Capstone Project, as well as **80% of all additional assignments**, including Weekly Projects and any required labs or homework assignments. 

##### Assignments You Should Grade + Provide Individual Feedback
The following assigments contain rubrics you can use to grade and comment on individual student work. See guidelines below.

- Capstone Project Deliverables
- Weekly Projects

##### Assignments You Should Collect + Provide Group or Opt-In Feedback
Collect the following assignments but only provide individual feedback on these if a student has specific questions. Otherwise, we recommend that you review them for completion and trends to address with the class as a whole.

- Lab Deliverables / Blog Posts
- Homework Assignments (as applicable)


## How to Grade

We've created a sample Google form you can copy to use for your own class. It asks students to link to their work, state any specific issues/questions, and describe their preferred feedback format. It also asks whether they would prefer to receive ***public*** feedback on Github or ***private*** feedback on Slack.

You can optionally adjust this form to limit the type of assignments they should submit, using the titles from the drop-down menu.

> Note: Feel free to modify this workflow based on local production team feedback.

## Guiding Principles for Project Feedback

- Rubrics are provided to **structure feedback for weekly and capstone projects**.
- Rubrics are based on a **simple 3-point scale**, tailored for each project.
- Metrics for "meets expectations" are clearly defined to help you provide **targeted feedback.**

## Best Practices for Project Feedback 

- Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when given their project assignment.
- Rubric categories and evaluation metrics should always be tied to the project specifications.
- Project categories are based off of the course standards, found in the [Data Science Workflow](../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf).
- Instructors should work with their local team to provide targeted feedback for **every** student. 
- Students should receive feedback on their projects **within 2 - 4 days** after submission!

## How to Use Our Project Rubrics

1. Make a copy of the relevant project rubric.
2. Score project requirements using rubric criteria.
  - _Note: Half points are ok (1.5) but beyond that, detailed percentages are unnecessary._
3. Enter any notes for specific project deliverables.
4. Enter any notes for overall student progress report, if applicable.

### Tips for Providing Project Feedback

- Provide precise praise
- Identify action step for improvement
- Give context as to why what action step is important
- End with a targeted question related to the action step, that tests whether the student has understood the feedback.
  - **Good Example**: "Great work! Your code is well organized. Good use of breaking tasks into separate functions. I see that in your app.js file you used the variable name x on line 84. Consider using more descriptive variable names. As a code reviewer, this would jump out at me. I want to know what every variable contains just by looking at the variable name itself. I do see some other descriptive variables! If we were to refactor this code, what would you want to rename x on line 84?"
  - **Poor Example**: "Great Work! You’re doing a good job with all this. Do you have any questions about anything?"

## In-Person Assessment Process

Instructional teams are encouraged to meet with students during office hours or one-on-one to review project feedback and discuss growth opportunities. Students should ideally have up to 30 minutes to review their project evaluation or do a code review up to a week after project submission.

### Model / Code Review Tips

Code review is not troubleshooting time. Instead, the goal is to review code and talk about actionable feedback for enhancing the student's project in the future.

- __Student (10 mins)__: Have the student walk through and defend their project / model / code.

- __Student (10 mins)__: Have the student answer the following questions.
  - What do you like most about your project?
  - What would you change if you started from scratch?
  - What would you like to add when you have more time?

- __Instructor/TA (10 mins)__: Talk through the evaluation, and share a “glow and grow”.
  - Make it personal – what about the project was exciting or intriguing?
  - Share any highlights and positive areas (“glow”) where the student went “above and beyond” the requirements
  - Share growth areas around time management, workflow, or project approach
  - Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate any difficulties the student encountered
  - Help the student prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project. 
  - Set 1 or 2 specific goals for the next project. 
  - If you’re reviewing the second or third project with the student, ask them how they did against the goals they set previously?

- Finally, be sure to report a summary of your evaluations back to your team, so you can evaluate how the class is doing as a whole!
